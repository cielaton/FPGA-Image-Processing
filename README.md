This is the final project of the course *PBL3: FPGA and Verilog Design*. The project utilizes an FPGA Altera DE2 to perform several basic image processing tasks such as brightness operation, inversion, and thresholding. In addition to the main stage, the board will send the image data through UART to the client for the result's demonstration.
